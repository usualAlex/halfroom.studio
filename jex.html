		<h1 class="story-title">Jex's Story</h1>
		<h2 class="description-text">Centers around a pawlet (bracelet) that has been passed around the universe sold cheap at every space market. Some saying that it's an ancient device holding huge 
		  quantities of energy. Despite some studies conducted, no such properties were ever found.<br><br> 
		  
		  Kara, a debt-ridden pilot entangled in some space piracy and bounty hunting stumbles upon the pawlet and gave it to Jex, her cat. 
		  
		  <br><br>
		   Recently an industrial planet has
			exploded creating chaos all around and... lots of valuable materials left to loot. Kara, Jex and a crew decide to take part and head towards the ex-planet. But the whole
			zone became a death-trap. Kara and the crew get caught in a wave of rogue asteroids proven to be impossible to avoid.<br><br> The ship gets hit!<br><br>The crew manages to run away using an escape pod. However, in all that rush Kara doesn’t realize until it’s too late: Jex is still on board. The ship 
			explodes. The energy from that explosion activated the pawlet now used by Jex which saves his life while getting thown off the ship and adrift in space.
			<br><br>
			Jex was a normal cat, this pawlet makes him stronger and able to speak. It also controls time and space based on energy it collects. It's the reason why Jex can hear sounds in space as they are interpreted by the pawlet.
